This code was generated in the linked YouTube video about making a speech-to-text voice assistant on a Raspberry Pi with a USB mic and MQTT:  [Video](https://youtu.be/_ERvoHMBDac)


## Installation
Just paste these commands to start your voice listener.  When you see `listening...`, it's working.  It works on Git Bash on Windows.  The code picks up the default mic:
```
git clone https://github.com/OhioIoT-Voice-Controls/Vosk-Listener-MQTT.git vosk-mqtt
cd vosk-mqtt
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Edit the IP address on line 16 of `listener.py` to match the IP address of the MQTT broker that you are running.

Then run:
```
./+run
```
If the script says `listening...`, it means you have successfully attached to the MQTT broker.  If you say "lights on" or "lights off", you will see that an MQTT messages is sent to the broker with topoic `voice/command' and then payload `set_lights_on` or `set_lights_off`.
